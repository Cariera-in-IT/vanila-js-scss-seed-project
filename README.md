# vanilla-js-seed
***WARNING***: this is a work in progress
## Reasoning
This aims to help new junior/non-developers aspiring to learn javascript/scss/sass.

It aims to give a hassle-free environment to help you focus on your learning instead of getting things to work.

The main reason behind this is to help you make your work public and easy to link in a portfolio with the use of the free github pages feature 


## prerequisites 
You need to have node.js installed, you can find the download here: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Commands
### Starting local environment
`npm run start`

### Sending all the changes to github
`npm run github`

## Working at your projects
Limitations:
* you are not allowed to move/rename the files `/src/js/main.js` and `/src/styles/main.scss`
* you should not mess around with the `webpack.config.js`
* you should not mess around with devDependencies of `package.json`

Notes:
* All feature js features should work out of the box ex. async
